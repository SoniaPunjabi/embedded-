## Car seat heating system
Takes 2 inputs :
1) Condition of the heater ( ON or OFF)
2) Checks if someone is seated on the seat
Only if the heater is on and someone is seated on the seat the LED glows
This has been designed using the atmega 328 microcontroller
3) Once the LED is on the temperature can be controlled by the user via a potentiometer which acts as a temperature sensor
4) The changes in the potentiometer are then displayed on the oscilloscope using pulse width modulation.
