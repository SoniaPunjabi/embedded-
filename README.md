## Car seat heating system
### Description
1) Takes 2 inputs
2) Condition of the heater ( ON or OFF)
3) Checks if someone is seated on the seat
Only if the heater is on and someone is seated on the seat the LED glows
This has been designed using the atmega 328 microcontroller
4) Once the LED is on the temperature can be controlled by the user via a potentiometer which acts as a temperature sensor
5) The changes in the potentiometer are then displayed on the oscilloscope using pulse width modulation.

#### ACTIVITY 1

The image shows that the LED turns on once the person is seated on the seat and the heater is turned ON.

The above image shows that once the LED turns ON the seated person can now adjust the temperature using the potentiometer that acts as a temperature sensor

These images represent the pulse width modulation as the resistance of the potentiometer increases the width of the pulse decreases
